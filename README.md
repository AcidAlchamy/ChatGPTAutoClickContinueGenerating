Was working on another bigger task, and simply threw the prompt together real quick. Works perfectly.

Put Python code and the ContinueGenerating.png image into the same folder and run the code through command prompt or powershell or something (to keep it persistent).

it'll AutoClick the "Continue Generating" button every time it comes up while you're working on a big task. I hate losing even a second to things loading so this saves me a lot of time believe it or not lol.

**To make your own ContinueGenerating.png simply ScreenShot/PrintScreen the image when it appears in the Chat. 
open Paint. 
Paste screenshot. 
Copy the Continue Generate button. 
Ctrl N. 
No. 
Ctrl V. 
Make sure the field of the image is the button itself and nothing extra.
Save as "ContinueGenerating.png"** -Save to same location as the code.
